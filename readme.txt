My final project is a space exploration game.  I used some premade textures
for the planets that I found online.  Primarily from NASA and from http://planetpixelemporium.com/planets.html.
I made the ship and the vinyl in Blender.  If you also want a better look at the scene, you
can comment the follow camera and uncomment the original one. One thing that I wish that I would have done better
is the action when the spaceship hits a planet.  Right now it just turns around and jumps like 20 pixels in the
other direction.
